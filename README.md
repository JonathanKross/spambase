# Classifying spam

## Description

Use the Spambase dataset to classify spam.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* Simple Bayesian analysis
* The importance of separating training and test data
* Create a Bayesian classifier
* Train your classifier
* Test your classifier

## Outline

Go to the UCI Machine Learning repository and [download the Spambase dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase). Make sure you [read the documentation for the data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.DOCUMENTATION).

Subsample the data set so 60% is training data and 40% is test data.

Then write code to classify the data into spam and not-spam, training with your training data and testing on your test data.
